### gitolite on docker

Runs a SSH server, serving gitolite as the `git` user. Non-root, that is, sshd
itself runs as `git`.

On the first start, it will run `gitolite setup` with a starting ssh key
you provided, or you can bootstrap with an existing gitolite-admin repository.

On subsequent starts, will run "gitolite setup" everytime to integrate any
outside changes.


### Changelog

- 2020-09-30: `sshd` no longer runs as `root`, but now runs as the `git` user.


### Examples

New installation:

    docker run -e SSH_KEY="$(cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)" elsdoerfer/gitolite

Use an existing gitolite installation:

    docker run -v /var/vcroot/git:/home/git/repositories elsdoerfer/gitolite


### Environment variables:

**SSH_KEY**

SSH public key for initial access to the gitolite-admin repository. If you
have an existing gitolite-admin repository, you may skip this.

**GIT_CONFIG_KEYS**
**LOCAL_CODE** (example value: *$ENV{HOME}/local*)

These will be inserted into gitolite.rc.

**TRUST_HOSTS**

Hostnames (only a single one is supported currently) to add to known_hosts, i.e. *github.com*.

**ADMIN**

SSH public key user when initializing gitolite. Defaults to *admin*.

**UID**

Git unix user UID. Repositories user owner.

**GID**

Git unix group GID. Repositories group owner.

### Directories you could bind mount (or use --volumes-from)

`/home/git/repositories` - The actual git repositories will be stored here.

`/etc/ssh` - The SSH host keys are stored here; they are generated when the container starts,
  and if you don't maintain them across containers, your clients will see warnings
  that they changed.


### SSH host key

The container needs a host key that is personal to your installation. This
host key authenticates the server to clients.

The first time the container starts, a host key will be generated. This won't
work well if your container is recreated often; because when the host key
changes, your git clients will show warnings and refuse to work.

To fix this, you have a couple of options:

1) You can make `/etc/ssh` a volume; the host key is stored there.

2) You can make sure a directory `/home/git/repositories/.ssh/host-keys`
   exists and contains the host keys. If that is the case, they will be used.
   You may want to prefer this over (1) because you only need a single volume.

3) TODO: Allow specifying the host keys via an env var.


### Mirroring

If your gitolite install needs to mirror (that is, execute git push itself), the
image can help you:

* The git user will have a ssh key generated for itself. Access the public key
  using `docker cp CID:/home/git/.ssh/id_rsa.pub .`.

  Note that if you keep recreating the container, rather than restarting, a new
  key will be generated. To prevent this, you can mount the  `/home/git/.ssh`
  directory. Alternatively, if the folder `/home/git/repositories/.ssh/client`
  exists, the files in that folder will be used (copied to `/home/git/.ssh`).
  You may want to prefer this over a separate volume for the ssh files.

* Use the `TRUST_HOSTS` environment variable to prepare the
  `.ssh/known_hosts` file. If given, `known_hosts` will be completely overridden
  on container start.


### Further customization

If you need to use things like custom hooks, you have different options:

* Point the *LOCAL_CODE* variable to something like "$ENV{HOME}/.gitolite/local", use the gitolite-admin repo to provide the data.
* You could bind mount files into the container (xxx: how to provide certain files (gitolite.rc) before setup runs?)
* Derive a custom Docker image, ADD the files (xxx: how to provide certain files (gitolite.rc) before setup runs?)
* Manually interact with a container, but lose it disposible nature.
